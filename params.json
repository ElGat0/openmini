{"name":"Openmini","tagline":"An open source, Minimoog-like digital synthesizer","body":"OpenMini - a Minimoog-like digital synthesizer\r\n======================\r\n\r\nOpenMini is a modern C++ implementation of a Minimoog-like digital synthesizer.\r\nIt aims at showing a simple, cross-platform yet efficient implementation of state of the art low-aliasing audio synthesis algorithms.\r\n\r\nAs its main goal is education, information sharing and (hopefully) inspiring other people to hack and spread audio synthesis tools and art, it is licensed under GPLv3 license.\r\nIt basically means that every one can use, copy and modify it with the sole condition that the source code must be made public.\r\n\r\nBuilding OpenMini - Using CMake\r\n==============================\r\n\r\nOpenMini currently has only been tested on Windows platforms, but its code aims at being portable.\r\nUnix-like systems, including Mac, soon to be tested continuously.\r\n\r\nOn most systems you can build the project using the following commands\r\n\r\n\t$ mkdir build && cd build\r\n\t$ cmake ..\r\n\t$ cmake --build .\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can point the CMake GUI tool to the CMakeLists.txt file and generate platform specific build project or IDE workspace.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n==================================\r\nOpenMini is under GPLv3\r\n\r\nSee the COPYING file for the full license text.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
